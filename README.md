# Python Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal Python learning repository! This is a structured collection of my progress as I develop my programming skills.

## What's Inside
*   **Fundamentals:** Core Python concepts - data structures, loops, functions, classes, and more.
*   **Projects:** Small to medium-sized applications that put theory into practice.
*   **Challenges:** My solutions to problems from platforms like LeetCode, Advent of Code, and others.
*   **Notes:** Resources, learnings, and useful references I've gathered along the way.

## Goals
*   To consistently practice and document my coding journey.
*   To develop clean, well-documented, and efficient code.
*   To build a portfolio that demonstrates growth and capability.

## Exercise Organization
For details on how exercises are numbered and organized, see the [README in the fundamentals folder](fundamentals/README.md).

*Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!*
