# Python Learning Exercises - Numbering System

## Overview

This folder contains my practice exercises organized by fundamental Python concepts. The exercise numbering follows a specific system that might seem unusual at first glance.

## Numbering Convention Explained

The exercises are organized sequentially, but grouped by chapter topics for better learning progression.

### The Pattern:
- **First digit**: Represents the sequential exercise set number
- **Second digit**: Represents the specific exercise within that set
- **Format**: `exercise_[set_number]-[exercise_number].py`

### Why This System?
- The first exercise (`Getting Started.py`) is a general introduction
- Subsequent exercises build sequentially while being grouped by chapter topics
- This maintains exercise continuity while allowing logical topic organization

### Chapter to Exercise Mapping:
| Chapter Topic | Exercise Files |
|---------------|----------------|
| Getting Started | `Getting Started.py` |
| Variables & Simple Data Types | `exercise_2_1.py`, `exercise_2_2.py`, `exercise_2_3.py`, etc. |
| Introducing Lists | `exercise_3_1.py`, `exercise_3_2.py`, `exercise_3_3.py`, etc. |
| [Next Chapter] | `exercise_4_1.py`, `exercise_4_2.py`, etc. |

## How to Use This Structure
1. Exercises are meant to be completed in numerical order
2. Each chapter folder contains related concept exercises
3. The numbering continues sequentially across chapters

## Note
This numbering system helps me track my progress while maintaining the logical flow of learning fundamental concepts.
